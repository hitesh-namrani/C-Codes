# 🧠 C Programming Practice – 1st Year Codes

# 

# Welcome to my C programming practice repository!This collection includes 39 C programs that I’ve saved and uploaded from the 70+ codes I wrote during my first year of B.Tech in Computer Science \& Engineering.

# 

# These programs reflect my journey into coding — building logic, learning syntax, and understanding core programming concepts using the C language.

# 

# 📚 Topics Covered

# 

# This repo includes beginner-level programs from the following topics:

# 

# ✅ Input / Output

# 

# ✅ If-Else, Nested Conditions

# 

# ✅ Switch Case

# 

# ✅ Loops – for, while, do-while

# 

# ✅ Arrays

# 

# ✅ Functions and Recursion

# 

# ✅ Pointers (including pointer to pointer)

# 

# ✅ Dynamic Memory Allocation

# 

# ✅ File Handling (organized in subfolders)

# 

# 🗂️ Folder Structure

# ├── hello\_world.c

# ├── calculator.c

# ├── grade\_calculator.c

# ├── swap\_numbers\_without\_temp.c

# 

# General logic-building programs are in the root folder or grouped into subfolders (arrays/, pointers/, etc.)

# 

# Each file handling program is inside its own folder (inside file\_handling/) with its own test.txt input file to avoid conflicts.

# 

# 📝 Notes

# 

# I wrote over 70 C programs from January 2025 to May 2025 during my 1st year of B.Tech.This repository includes the 39 programs I was able to recover and organize.

# 

# These programs are mostly uncommented, written for practice purposes only.

# 

# I may revisit these codes later to improve logic, add comments, or convert to functions and modular formats.

# 

# 📅 Timeline

# 

# 🛠️ Code written: January 2025 – May 2025

# 

# ⬆️ Uploaded to GitHub: July 2025

# 

# 🎯 My Goal

# 

# This repo is not just a code archive — it's a snapshot of where I started.As I move into my 2nd year of B.Tech, I’ll be focusing on:

# 

# ✅ C++

# 

# ✅ Data Structures \& Algorithms (DSA)

# 

# ✅ Mini-projects

# 

# ✅ AI, Machine Learning \& Python (later stages)

# 

# By publishing this repo, I’m documenting the foundation I built before moving forward.

# 

# 🚀 How to Run the Programs

# 

# Clone the repo:

# 

# git clone https://github.com/hitesh-namrani/c-programming-practice.git

# 

# Navigate to the file/folder you want.

# 

# Compile using GCC:

# 

# gcc filename.c -o output

# ./output

# 

# For file-handling programs:

# 

# Navigate into the respective subfolder

# 

# Make sure test.txt is present

# 

# Run the .c file in the same folder

# 

# 📖 Sample file-handling program setup

# 

# Folder: file\_handling/odd\_numbers/

# 

# print\_odd\_numbers\_in\_file.c

# test.txt

# 

# test.txt contains numbers (e.g. 1 2 3 4 5) which the program reads and processes.

# 

# 📌 Future Plans

# 

# Upload beginner C++ programs (I have 10+ ready)

# 

# Begin pushing DSA practice code soon

# 

# Add comments and refactor older codes in free time

# 

# Build a few mini-projects as I learn more
